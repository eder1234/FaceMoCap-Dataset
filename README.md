TODO
* Add a description of the project
* Update the tutorial
* * open3D to visualize point clouds
* * compatible with PLY or another point cloud format
* Add control_df

Notes:
* pathology_df is a bad choice of a name; it should be named as mattieu_df instead.
* patients_df is the complete dataframe that contains all the information about the patients.
